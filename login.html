        <h2 style="margin-top: 30%" id="WAI">Who am I</h2>
        <main style="margin-top: 0%;">The person making this website and advocating for this issue is Marita Natasha P. Bautista, a grade 9 student from Philippine Science High School. I would like to characterize myself as a person who is passionate about politics and leadership. I like radicalizing my classmates/jk </main>
        <h2 id="WIF">What is FGM</h2>
        <main style="margin-top: 0%;"> Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) refers to all procedures that involve the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or any other injury to any of the female genital organs for non-medical reasons (UNFPA, 2022). It causes severe bleeding, urination problems, cysts, infections, complications in childbirth, and increased risk of newborn deaths. FGM is mostly carried out in young girls in infancy to the age of 15 . More than 200 million girls and women have undergone FGM in 30 countries where it is practiced (WHO, 2022). The practice still permeates today due to deeply entrenched gender equality. To many communities, it is a rite of passage, a prerequisite to marriage, or a practice for their religious beliefs (UNFPA, 2022). Whatever the reason may be, it is undeniable that this is a human rights violation.</main>
        <h2 id="WSA">Why should you advocate against it</h2>
        <main style="margin-top: 0%;">How long have we been cutting women? Well, it's been 2000 years. There has been a decline in FGM rates, but it isn't applicable to all countries and levels vary per country (WHO, 2022). As a human rights violation, people should recognize and fight this issue. Efforts to abolish this issue focus on an education- focused solutions. The UNFPA 's advocates for educating communities about the issue, then the communities would reflect and create a consensus regarding the issue (UNFPA, 2022).</main>
